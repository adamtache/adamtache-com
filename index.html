					I am a current junior at Duke University, studying Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>

					In the past, I operated a technology based YouTube channel (called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/techtechmantv">TechTechManTV</a>) where I worked with tech companies to review hardware and software products, as well as covered general tech trends and iOS jailbreaking. I accumulated over 30k subscribers, 20 million views, and published 500+ videos as part of the YouTube Partner Program. I also ran a technology and gaming blog called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/psvitavlog">PSVitaVlog</a>.<br/><br/>

					I aspire to develop high-impact technology, with some of my current interests being software engineering, virtual and augmented reality, robotics and automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I strongly believe these fields are essential to the advancement of cutting-edge technology and the future of humanity and strive to contribute anyway I can.<br/><br/>

					Aside from these subjects, I'm extremely curious about how things physically compute. I love disecting topics down to the most basic level and understanding each component fully. I'm very interested in physics and statistics and love reading about these fields to complement my university studies.<br/><br/>

					Besides development, I absolutely love traveling and exploring new places, cultures, and food, along with video production and photography (the background image to this site is part of a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/133344400@N04/albums/72157653059035801">Black & White photography album</a> I released last year).<br/><br/>

					You can contact me at my email <a href="at201@duke.edu">at201@duke.edu</a>. I'd love to collaborate on a project or hear from you, so feel free to reach out!
